'''Advantages:
1.various data visualization task, including exploratory data analysis, scientific plotting and creating
publication-quality plots.
2.it is good for scenario where we need fine grained controls over plot customization
and create complex / specialized visualizations.
3. cross platform and easy integration of numpy.

DisAdvantages:
1.Dependency on external libraries.
2.Limited 3D plotting capabilities.

Applications:
1. scientific research
2. finance, data analysis
3. education and engineering'''

Layers:
1. scripting layer - top level - simple plots to mimic MATLAB's plotting commands.
2. artist layer- full control and appearance of the plot.
3. backend layer- lowest level -how to render and how to use different GUI (pyQT,GTK)
