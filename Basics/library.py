# matplot lib
'''
1. various data visualization task, exploratory data analysis, scientific plotting and creating publication-quality plots.
2. good for scenario where we need fine grained controls over plot customization and creat specialized visualizations.
3. cross platform and easy integration with numpy.

cons: limited 3D plotting, dependencies on external libraries

Apps: scientific research, finance, data analysis and education.

Layers:
1. scripting layer- top level - simple plots to mimic MATLAB plotting commands.
2. artist layer- full control and appearance of the plot.
3. background layer- lowest level - how to render and how to use different GUI ex: pyQT
